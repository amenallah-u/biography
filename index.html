      Bawendi joined <a href="https://www.mit.edu/">the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)</a> in the 1990s,
       where he is now a professor of chemistry and holds the Lester Wolfe Professorship.<br>
      <span>He is internationally recognized for:</span>
      <ul>
      <li>Developing methods for synthesizing quantum dots with precise control over their size and properties.</li>
      <li>Pioneering a method called <span>“hot-injection synthesis”</span> that revolutionized how nanocrystals are made.</li> </ul></section>
    
      <section id="p4">
        <h1 class="t2">🏆 Nobel Prize in Chemistry (2023)</h1>
<p>In October 2023, Bawendi was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry alongside Louis Brus and Alexei Ekimov.

Reason:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>“For the discovery and development of quantum dots,”</i>
which are tiny semiconductor particles with unique optical and electronic properties. <h4>These are used in:</h4>
 <li>Medical imaging</li>
  <li>LED and QLED display technology</li>
  <li>Solar cells and quantum computing research</li>
</li>
  <h4>🇹🇳 Connection to Tunisia</h4>
  <li>Although he built his career in the U.S., Bawendi is proud of his Tunisian heritage:</li>
  <li>He lived in Tunisia during his early childhood.</li>
